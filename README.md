# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This project was made as the test task in 05/2021.

**Note**
In the task it was said to show on the right side of the page months sorted starting from the month of the task execution.
I've made it to start from the current month on the client device, supposing this could be more usefull in practice.
Anyway, since the task most likely will be checked in the same month as executed, this implementation should meet the requirement :)
